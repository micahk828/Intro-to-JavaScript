  <p id="change">In this lesson, I learned how to use JavaScript in an HTML file. Linking it was similar to linkking a CSS file as they both go in the head. I learned how to signify different functions and add them to bguttons in html. This was different from block mode in code.org as we were coding in text mode. I also practiced event-driven programming and how to use it. I also learned how to change certain features of an element with a button. When naming functions, you have to be case-sensitive, meaning that you have to spell it exactly as you did the first time or else your code won't work. In the future, I hope to learn how to undo commands by pressing the same button.</p>
